# This is a simple kustomize transformer plugin that allows
# injecting configuration for a site into the blueprint.
# It's current purpose is to inject the pull secret and ssh public key
# into the site config such that it doesn't have to be stored in git iwth the
# blueprint. Instead, it's taken from the WORK_DIR (but could eventually be
# retrieved from a k8s secret or a vault instead).
# The same mechanism could be used in the future to template in more site
# configuration parameters for which a purist "kustomization" is too cumbersome.

# set -x
set -e

# Skip the config file name argument.
